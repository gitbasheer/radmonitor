# Documentation Audit To-Do List

**Created:** December 2024
**Purpose:** Address discrepancies between README documentation and actual project structure
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress (6/9 main items completed, 60+ sub-items to review)

---

## 📋 Summary of Findings

After comparing `README.md` and `README_graph.md` with the actual project structure and searching for all TODO/review items in the codebase, I identified **9 main categories** requiring attention. As of December 2024, **6 of 9 main items have been resolved**, with 60+ sub-items consolidated for future work.

---

## ✅ Action Items

### 1. **Missing JavaScript Module Documentation** ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue:** `assets/js/data-layer-example.js` exists but is not mentioned in either README

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium

**Actions:**
- [x] Review the purpose of `data-layer-example.js` ✅
- [x] Decide if it should be:
  - a) Added to README documentation ✅
  - b) Moved to `examples/` directory ✅
  - c) Removed if obsolete
- [x] Update README accordingly ✅

**Questions to Evaluate:**
- Is this file actively used or just example code?
- Should example files be documented separately?
- Would developers benefit from knowing about this example?

---

### 2. **TypeScript File Discrepancy** ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue:** `dashboard.d.ts` is mentioned in `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` but doesn't exist

**Priority:** 🟠 High (if TypeScript support is planned)

**Actions:**
- [x] Verify if `dashboard.d.ts` was: Deleted after refactoring ✅
- [x] Either:
  - Create the missing type definitions
  - Remove references from documentation ✅
  - Update docs to reflect current TypeScript strategy

**Resolution:** Confirmed the file was deleted after refactoring. No action needed since TypeScript support is not a current goal.

---

### 3. **Undocumented Legacy Scripts** ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue:** `scripts/legacy/` directory contains 3 shell scripts not mentioned in main README

**Priority:** 🟢 Low

**Scripts found:**
- `run_with_cors_direct.sh`
- `run_local.sh`
- `run_local_auto.sh`

**Actions:**
- [x] Determine if legacy scripts are:
  - a) Still functional
  - b) Superseded by new scripts ✅
  - c) Kept for backward compatibility ✅
- [x] Add note in README about legacy directory OR remove if obsolete ✅
- [x] Consider adding deprecation notices to legacy scripts

**Resolution:** Keeping legacy scripts in place for backward compatibility but not documenting them in README as they are superseded by new scripts.

---

### 4. **Empty Configuration Directory** ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue:** `src/config/` exists but is empty (only contains `__pycache__`)

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium

**Actions:**
- [x] Determine intended purpose of `src/config/` ✅
- [x] Either:
  - a) Remove empty directory ✅
  - b) Add planned configuration modules
  - c) Document why it exists but is empty
- [x] Update project structure in README ✅

**Resolution:** Directory was intended for `settings.py` which was never fully implemented. Removed the empty directory to clean up project structure.

---

### 5. **Missing/Replaced Script Reference** ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue:** README mentions `src/data/fetch_kibana_data.sh` as being replaced by FastAPI endpoint, but file doesn't exist

**Priority:** 🟢 Low

**Actions:**
- [x] Update README to clarify that:
  - The bash script has been fully replaced ✅
  - The functionality now exists in `/api/fetch-kibana-data` endpoint ✅
- [x] Remove any remaining references to the old bash script ✅
- [x] Ensure migration is documented properly ✅

**Resolution:** Updated README to clarify that data fetching is now handled by `generate_dashboard.py` which tries FastAPI endpoint first, then falls back to CORS proxy. Removed outdated file references from project structure.

---

### 6. **Outdated "To Review" Section** ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue:** README contains a "To Review" section with outdated information about test failures and architecture

**Priority:** 🔴 High (affects documentation accuracy)

**Actions:**
- [x] Run current test suite to get accurate metrics
- [x] Update or remove the "To Review" section ✅ (Removed)
- [x] Move any still-relevant items to GitHub issues ✅ (Added below)
- [x] Update architecture diagram if needed

**Resolution:** Removed the outdated "To Review" section from README and consolidated all review items into this document (see section 8 below).

---

### 7. **Minor Path Correction**

**Issue:** README shows `assets/templates/` but file is actually at `assets/index.html.template`

**Priority:** 🟢 Low

**Actions:**
- [ ] Update README to show correct path: `assets/index.html.template`
- [ ] Verify no other path discrepancies exist
- [ ] Consider if template should be in a templates directory

**Questions to Evaluate:**
- Should we create a templates directory for consistency?
- Are there other templates planned?
- Is the current location more convenient?

## 🏗️ Current RAD Monitor Architecture Overview

### Simple Architecture List:

1. **Data Source**
   - Elasticsearch/Kibana (production data source)
   - Requires authentication via Elastic cookie

2. **Backend Services**
   - **CORS Proxy** (`cors_proxy.py`) - Port 8889, handles cross-origin requests
   - **Enhanced CORS Proxy** (`cors_proxy_enhanced.py`) - Adds typed endpoints (optional)
   - **FastAPI Server** (`dev_server_fastapi.py`) - Port 8000, provides REST API + WebSocket (optional)
   - **Unified Dev Server** (`dev_server_unified.py`) - Smart auto-detection of capabilities

3. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - **Dashboard Generator** (`generate_dashboard.py`) - Main orchestrator
   - **Data Processor** (`src/data/process_data.py`) - Handles data transformation
   - **Processors** (`src/data/processors/`) - Score calculation, traffic analysis, HTML generation
   - **Pydantic Models** (`src/data/models.py`) - Type-safe data validation

4. **Frontend Architecture**
   - **ES6 Modules** (`assets/js/`) - Modular JavaScript architecture
   - **DataLayer** (`data-layer.js`) - Centralized state management with caching
   - **API Interface** (`api-interface.js`) - Unified API abstraction
   - **UI Components** - UIUpdater, ConfigManager, ConsoleVisualizer
   - **Compatibility Layer** (`src/dashboard.js`) - Bridges old tests with new modules

5. **Deployment**
   - **GitHub Pages** - Production hosting
   - **GitHub Actions** - Automated updates every 45 minutes
   - **Static Generation** - Pre-rendered HTML with embedded data

6. **Development Tools**
   - **npm scripts** - Unified commands for all operations
   - **Test Suite** - Vitest (JS), pytest (Python), bats (Bash)
   - **Port Management** - Automatic cleanup and conflict resolution

### 🤔 Questions/Comments/Concerns/Opportunities:

**Architecture Concerns:**
- 🔴 **Dual proxy architecture** - Having both basic and enhanced CORS proxy creates maintenance overhead
- 🟡 **Optional FastAPI** - The optional nature of FastAPI creates two code paths to maintain
- 🟡 **Static vs Dynamic** - Mix of static generation and real-time updates adds complexity

**Opportunities:**
- 💡 **Consolidate proxies** - Merge cors_proxy.py and cors_proxy_enhanced.py into one FastAPI-based solution
- 💡 **WebSocket everywhere** - Use WebSocket for all real-time updates instead of polling
- 💡 **Bundle optimization** - Current ES6 modules aren't bundled, could improve load time
- 💡 **Service worker** - Could cache API responses and work offline
- 💡 **GraphQL consideration** - Complex queries might benefit from GraphQL instead of REST

**Questions:**
- ❓ Why maintain both static generation AND real-time updates? Pick one primary mode?
- ❓ Is the compatibility layer (`src/dashboard.js`) still needed or can tests be updated?
- ❓ Should FastAPI be mandatory instead of optional to reduce code paths?
- ❓ Why is config management scattered (env vars, localStorage, API) instead of centralized?
- ❓ Is the 45-minute GitHub Actions schedule optimal for the use case?

**Performance Observations:**
- ✅ Good: DataLayer caching reduces API calls
- ✅ Good: Performance monitoring built into the system
- ⚠️ Concern: No CDN for static assets
- ⚠️ Concern: Full page regeneration every 45 minutes seems inefficient

**Security Considerations:**
- 🔒 Cookie-based auth is handled client-side (potential security risk)
- 🔒 No rate limiting on API endpoints
- 🔒 CORS proxy could be abused if publicly accessible

**Developer Experience:**
- ✅ Excellent: Unified dev server with auto-detection
- ✅ Excellent: Comprehensive test coverage
- ⚠️ Could improve: Documentation scattered across many .md files
- ⚠️ Could improve: No API client SDK for external consumers
