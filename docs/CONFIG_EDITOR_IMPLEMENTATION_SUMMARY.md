# Configuration Editor Implementation Summary

## What Was Added

A simple UI panel for configuration management has been successfully added to the RAD Monitor dashboard.

### New Files Created

1. **`assets/js/config-editor.js`**
   - Simple configuration editor component
   - Uses ConfigService API for all operations
   - Provides load, edit, save, and reset functionality

2. **`docs/CONFIG_EDITOR_UI_GUIDE.md`**
   - User guide for the configuration editor
   - Includes usage examples and troubleshooting

### Files Modified

1. **`assets/templates/index.html.template`**
   - Added "Advanced Configuration Editor" section to control panel
   - Included necessary script references (api-interface.js, fastapi-integration.js, config-service.js, config-editor.js)
   - Added HTML structure for the editor UI

2. **`assets/css/dashboard.css`**
   - Added styling for the configuration editor
   - Clean, consistent design matching existing dashboard style
   - Responsive form fields with focus states

## Key Features

1. **Load Current Config** - Fetches configuration from backend
2. **Edit Settings** - Modify processing, dashboard, and Elasticsearch settings
3. **Save Changes** - Persists to backend and refreshes dashboard
4. **Reset to Defaults** - Restore all settings with confirmation

## Technical Implementation

- Uses async/await for all API calls
- Integrates seamlessly with existing ConfigService
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Provides visual feedback for all operations
- Auto-initializes when DOM is ready

## How It Works

1. User clicks "LOAD CURRENT CONFIG" button
2. ConfigEditor fetches config via `ConfigService.getConfig()`
3. Dynamic form fields are generated based on config structure
4. User edits values in the form fields
5. On save, each field is updated via `ConfigService.updateSetting()`
6. Changes are persisted with `ConfigService.saveToBackend()`
7. Dashboard automatically refreshes with new settings

## No Breaking Changes

- All existing configuration functionality remains intact
- ConfigManager continues to work as before
- New editor is purely additive - no modifications to existing code logic
- Uses the already-implemented ConfigService API

The configuration editor provides a user-friendly way to manage dashboard settings without needing to edit JSON files or use the API directly.
