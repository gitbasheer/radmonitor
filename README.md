# RAD Monitor Dashboard

A real-time traffic monitoring dashboard for RAD (Recommendations and Discovery) events. Shows you when traffic drops so you can catch issues fast.

## Live Dashboard

**Production URL**: https://balkhalil-godaddy.github.io/vh-rad-traffic-monitor/

Just need to monitor traffic? Go to the URL above, enter your Kibana cookie when prompted, and you're good to go.

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Dashboard<br/>GitHub Pages] -->|HTTPS| B[Proxy<br/>Netlify Function]
    B -->|Authenticated| C[Kibana API]
    C -->|Query| D[Elasticsearch<br/>traffic-* indices]

    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#c8e6c9
    style C fill:#fff9c4
    style D fill:#ffccbc
```

The dashboard queries Elasticsearch for RAD events, compares current traffic to historical baselines, and flags anything that looks wrong.

## Getting Started

### For Monitoring (No Setup)

1. Go to https://balkhalil-godaddy.github.io/vh-rad-traffic-monitor/
2. Get your Kibana cookie:
   - Open Kibana
   - F12 â†’ Network tab â†’ Refresh page
   - Find any request â†’ Copy the Cookie header value
   - Look for the `sid=Fe26.2**...` part
3. Paste cookie in dashboard when prompted
4. Watch your traffic

### For Development

Clone and install:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/balkhalil-godaddy/vh-rad-traffic-monitor.git
cd vh-rad-traffic-monitor
npm install
pip install -r requirements-enhanced.txt
```

Run locally:
```bash
npm run dev  # Starts everything you need on http://localhost:8000
```

## Architecture

    subgraph "Frontend"
        A[index.html] --> B[api-client-unified.js]
        B --> C[config-service.js]
    end

        E[settings.json]

    end

    B --> G
    G --> H[Kibana/Elasticsearch]
```

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Check if everything's configured right
./scripts/verify-config.sh

# Test the proxy
curl https://regal-youtiao-09c777.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/proxy

# Redeploy proxy (if you change proxy.js)
cd proxy-service && npx netlify deploy --prod

# Run tests
npm test              # JavaScript tests
npm run test:all      # Everything

# Generate static dashboard (for GitHub Actions)
npm run generate
```

## Configuration

The important stuff lives in these files:

**`config/production.json`** - This gets deployed to GitHub Pages
```json
{
  "corsProxy": {
    "url": "https://regal-youtiao-09c777.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/proxy"
  },
  "elasticsearch": {
    "path": "/api/console/proxy?path=traffic-*/_search&method=POST"
  }
}
```

**Don't change these**:
- The proxy URL (unless you deploy a new one)
- The index pattern (`traffic-*`)
- The Kibana proxy path format

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages (Dashboard)
Pushes to `main` automatically deploy via GitHub Actions. Takes about 2-3 minutes.

### Netlify (Proxy)
The proxy function is deployed to Netlify. To update it:
```bash
cd proxy-service
npx netlify deploy --prod
```

## Authentication

The dashboard needs a Kibana session cookie. The cookie:
- Expires after 24 hours
- Can be entered as `Fe26.2**...` or `sid=Fe26.2**...` (proxy handles both)
- Gets stored in localStorage

## Common Issues

**"Invalid cookie header"**
- Your cookie expired. Get a fresh one from Kibana.

**No data showing**
- Check the browser console
- Make sure you're looking at `traffic-*` indices
- Verify time range isn't too restrictive

**CORS errors**
- The proxy might be down. Test it with curl (see commands above)
- Redeploy the proxy if needed

**Wrong index pattern errors**
- Run `./scripts/verify-config.sh` to check configuration
- Make sure all configs use `traffic-*` not `usi*`

## What This Monitors

The dashboard tracks RAD events matching this pattern:
- `pandc.vnext.recommendations.feed.feed*`

It compares:
- Current period: Last 12 hours (configurable)
- Baseline: June 1-9, 2025 (8 days)

Status levels:
- ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**: Traffic dropped >80%
- ðŸŸ¡ **WARNING**: Traffic dropped 50-80%
- ðŸŸ¢ **NORMAL**: Traffic looks fine
- ðŸ”µ **INCREASED**: Traffic is up

## Need Help?

1. Check the console for errors
2. Run `./scripts/verify-config.sh`
3. Test the proxy is alive
4. Make sure your cookie is fresh

That's it. Keep it simple. Monitor your traffic. Fix issues fast.
