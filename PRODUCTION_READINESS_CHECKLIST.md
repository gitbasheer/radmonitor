# Production Readiness Checklist

This checklist identifies all issues that must be resolved before production deployment.

## 🚨 CRITICAL Issues (Must Fix Before Production)

### 1. Security Vulnerabilities

#### XSS Vulnerabilities (innerHTML Usage)
**Status**: ❌ **NOT FIXED** - Found 75+ instances of innerHTML usage
**Risk**: High - Direct XSS attack vector

Files with innerHTML that need fixing:
- [ ] `ui-updater.js` - 19 instances (most critical - user data displayed)
- [ ] `dashboard-simplified.js` - 3 instances
- [ ] `components/ux-components.js` - 13 instances
- [ ] `formula-builder/ui/enhanced-visual-builder.js` - 8 instances
- [ ] `formula-builder/ui/enhanced-formula-editor.js` - 6 instances
- [ ] `formula-builder/ui/formula-editor.js` - 8 instances
- [ ] `components/auth-overlay.js` - 1 instance
- [ ] `components/loading-overlay.js` - 1 instance
- [ ] `ai-formula-integration.js` - 6 instances
- [ ] `connection-status-manager.js` - 1 instance
- [ ] `formula-builder/integration/dashboard-connector.js` - 9 instances

**Solution**: Replace all innerHTML with safe DOM manipulation methods or use a sanitization library.

#### Cookie Security Gaps
**Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY FIXED** - Encryption implemented but not everywhere

Files still storing unencrypted cookies:
- [ ] `config-editor.js` (line 323)
- [ ] Pre-configured cookie support in production (config-service.js lines 137-140, 226-246)

### 2. Hardcoded URLs

**Status**: ❌ **NOT FIXED** - 20+ files with hardcoded URLs
**Risk**: Medium - Deployment flexibility issues

JavaScript files with hardcoded URLs:
- [ ] `config-service.js` (lines 50, 53, 172, 173, 347, 348) - `http://localhost:8000`
- [ ] `ui-updater.js` (line 93) - Hardcoded Kibana URL
- [ ] `api-client-unified.js` (lines 34, 48, 422) - localhost, WebSocket, ES URLs
- [ ] `centralized-auth.js` (line 207) - `http://localhost:8000`
- [ ] `fastapi-integration.js` (lines 37-38) - API and WebSocket URLs
- [ ] `direct-elasticsearch-client.js` (line 7) - ES URL
- [ ] `cors-direct-override.js` (line 47) - ES URL

Python files with defaults (acceptable but should use config):
- [ ] `config/models.py` - Has defaults but these are OK as they're configurable
- [ ] `bin/server_enhanced.py` - Uses environment variables properly

**Solution**: All URLs should come from configuration, not hardcoded strings.

### 3. Incomplete Implementations (TODOs)

**Status**: ❌ **NOT COMPLETE** - Critical functionality missing

#### Formula Builder API Endpoints Missing
The following endpoints are referenced in frontend but NOT implemented in production server:
- [ ] `POST /api/formulas/validate` (server_enhanced.py has TODO)
- [ ] `POST /api/formulas/execute` (server_enhanced.py has TODO)
- [ ] `GET /api/formulas/functions` (not implemented)
- [ ] `GET /api/formulas/fields` (not implemented)
- [ ] `POST /api/formulas/save` (not implemented)
- [ ] `GET /api/formulas/history` (not implemented)
- [ ] Natural language to formula conversion (server_enhanced.py has TODO)

#### UI Component TODOs
- [ ] Formula formatting not implemented (formula-editor.js:414)
- [ ] ES query generation not implemented (enhanced-visual-builder.js:944)
- [ ] Undo/Redo not implemented (enhanced-visual-builder.js:1308, 1313)
- [ ] Formula text parsing incomplete (enhanced-visual-builder.js:1435)

### 4. Memory Leaks

**Status**: ❌ **NOT FIXED** - Multiple memory leak sources identified

From CLEANUP_CHECKLIST.md:
- [ ] Unbounded caches in `data-layer.js`, `api-client-unified.js`, `config-service.js`
- [ ] Unbounded Maps in formula builder components
- [ ] Event listeners not cleaned up in multiple files
- [ ] Timers/intervals not cleared (wsReconnectInterval, syntaxHighlightTimer, etc.)
- [ ] Global references not removed (window.Dashboard, etc.)
- [ ] DOM references retained after removal
- [ ] Web Workers not properly cleaned up

## 🟡 HIGH Priority Issues

### 5. Test Coverage

**Status**: ❌ **BROKEN** - Many tests failing or missing

From BROKEN_TESTS_TODO.md:
- [ ] `test_centralized_config.py` - References deleted src/ directory
- [ ] `test_config_api.py` - References deleted src/ directory
- [ ] `test_data_models.py` - References deleted src/ directory
- [ ] `test_multi_rad_support.py` - References deleted src/ directory

From ALL_TESTS_CATALOG.md:
- [ ] ~110 files without any test coverage
- [ ] Formula builder components lack tests
- [ ] UI components have no tests
- [ ] Emil system implementation incomplete

### 6. Unused Files

**Status**: ❌ **NOT CLEANED** - Many obsolete files remain

Must delete (from UNUSED_FILES_AUDIT.md):
- [ ] Entire `archive/` directory
- [ ] Old backend files: `bin/dev_server.py`, `bin/cors_proxy.py`, `bin/centralized_api.py`
- [ ] Old API clients: `api-client.js`, `api-client-fastapi.js`, `api-client-simplified.js`
- [ ] Test files for deleted functionality
- [ ] Multiple demo/test HTML files
- [ ] Phase documentation files (PHASE_*.md)

## 🟢 MEDIUM Priority Issues

### 7. Configuration System Integration

**Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY COMPLETE** - New system created but not fully integrated

- [ ] Update all hardcoded URLs to use new config system
- [ ] Ensure all environment variables use new `SECTION__KEY` format
- [ ] Migrate remaining JSON configs to YAML
- [ ] Update all server files to use `from config import get_config`

### 8. Error Handling

**Status**: ⚠️ **INCONSISTENT** - Error handling varies across modules

- [ ] Standardize error responses across all API endpoints
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries in UI components
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for production debugging
- [ ] Ensure sensitive information is never exposed in errors

### 9. Documentation

**Status**: ✅ **GOOD** - Configuration docs created, but need updates

- [ ] Update README.md with final production deployment steps
- [ ] Document all API endpoints (especially formula builder)
- [ ] Add security best practices guide
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Production Deployment Blockers Summary

### Must Fix Before Production:
1. **XSS Vulnerabilities** - 75+ innerHTML uses creating attack vectors
2. **Hardcoded URLs** - 20+ files preventing flexible deployment
3. **Missing API Endpoints** - Formula builder non-functional
4. **Memory Leaks** - Will cause production instability
5. **No Test Coverage** - Cannot verify stability

1. Delete unused files (archive/, old backends, etc.)
2. Fix hardcoded URLs using config system
3. Implement missing formula API endpoints
4. Add XSS protection library for innerHTML

### Longer Term (3-5 days):
1. Fix all memory leaks with proper cleanup
2. Restore test coverage
3. Complete formula builder implementation
4. Security audit and penetration testing
