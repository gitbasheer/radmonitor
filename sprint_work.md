# Sprint Work Assignments - VH RAD Traffic Monitor

## Overview
This document contains comprehensive work tickets for 7 development agents to work in parallel on critical issues identified in the VH RAD Traffic Monitor project. Agent 1 (Lead Dev) will oversee and coordinate the sprint.

**Sprint Goal:** Prepare VH RAD Traffic Monitor for production deployment with FastAPI, fixing all critical security vulnerabilities, memory leaks, and configuration issues.

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. No security vulnerabilities (all cookies encrypted, no hardcoded secrets, no sensitive logging)
2. No memory leaks (stable 24+ hour operation)
3. Fully configurable deployment (works in dev/staging/prod, all URLs/ports from env/config, all validated at startup)
4. Comprehensive test coverage and monitoring (including security, integration, and memory leak tests)
5. Formula Builder working end-to-end (core production feature, all imports resolved)

## Sprint Coordination Notes

### Dependencies
- Agent 3's cookie standardization must complete first (highest security priority)
- Agent 2's memory fixes are critical and block production deployment
- Agent 4's URL fixes block deployment to different environments
- Agent 5's tests depend on fixes from Agents 2, 3, and 4
- Agent 6's monitoring should track metrics from Agent 2's performance fixes
- Agent 7's formula builder fixes are critical for feature completeness
- Agent 7 should coordinate with Agent 4 on API client refactoring
- **All new config variables must be validated in `env_validator.py` and documented in `docs/ENVIRONMENT_VALIDATION.md`.**
- **The environment validation system now enforces configuration correctness at startup and will block deployment if any required variable is missing or invalid.**
- **Security, memory, and configuration issues are tightly coupled and must be resolved in parallel for production readiness.**

### Risk Mitigation
- If any CRITICAL issue cannot be resolved, escalate immediately to Agent 1
- Security issues (Agent 3) take precedence over all other work
- Memory leaks (Agent 2) must be fixed before production deployment
- Formula Builder (Agent 7) is a core feature - modules exist but imports may need fixing
- Cookie encryption standardization is only complete in two files; all others must be updated

### Success Criteria
- All CRITICAL security issues resolved (cookie encryption in all files, no hardcoded URLs, no sensitive logging)
- Memory leaks fixed - 30+ issues identified, application must be stable for 24+ hour sessions
- Successful deployment to production environment with FastAPI
- All tests passing with 80%+ coverage on critical paths
- Monitoring shows healthy metrics (memory stable, <500ms response times)
- No hardcoded configuration values in codebase (all must be validated)
- Formula Builder fully functional with all imports resolved
- Single consolidated API client implementation
- All cookie storage uses centralized encryption and a single key

- Day 4-5: Configuration fixes (Agent 4), API consolidation (Agent 7), and testing (Agent 5)
- Day 6: Final integration and infrastructure setup (Agent 6)
- Day 7: Production deployment readiness review

### Daily Sync Requirements
